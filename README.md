# Extractor
MATLAB code for CSI extract simulation


## What is Extractor Simulation?
Extractor Simulation is a tool that 
* provides the database from Remcom 3D ray-tracing.
* generates the channel frequency response (CFR) for different bandwidths and antenna arrays.
* estimates the location-bearing parameters, such as received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival (TOA), or angle of arrival (AOA), of the propagation paths from the CFR.


## Why use Extractor Simulation?
When finding the agent‚Äôs position with the estimated location-bearing parameters, the factors that affect the parameters‚Äô estimation should be considered. For example, 
* when the LoS path is blocked, the parameters of the LoS cannot be estimated.
* when the bandwidth is small, it has a worse time-domain resolution. Thus, the dense multipath cannot be extracted accurately.
* the AOA estimation is affected by the number and arrangement of the antennas on the agent‚Äôs array.
Extractor Simulation can help us reveal the factors that affect the localization.


## How to use Extractor Simulation?


### Step 1: Download the codes and folders, as shown in Figure 1

### Step 2: Download the database. 
The ‚ÄúRay-tracing Database‚Äù is a folder that contains ray-tracing databases of different environments. As shown in Figure 2, in one of the environment‚Äôs folders, there is a folder that includes the Remcom ray-tracing results named ‚ÄúResults_for_Mat,‚Äù some Matlab codes that have the positions of the agents and anchors, and a map.png which shows the map of the environment. The databases in the ‚ÄúResults_for_Mat‚Äù are needed to be download from the following link:
*	Indoor NSYSU

### Step 3: Open the main code with MATLAB.
Some parameters need to be set before running the main code, as shown in Figure 3. The parameters are in ‚ÄúSetEnvironment.m‚Äù, ‚ÄúSetTransmission.m‚Äù, and ‚ÄúSetAntenna.m‚Äù.

<p align="center">Figure 3. The main code</p>

### Step 4: Set the parameters in ‚ÄúSetEnvironment.m‚Äù.
* `environment`: choose an environment for simulation. The environment name should be the same as the folder name in the Ray-tracing Database. Currently, you can set it as
  * `'Indoor NSYSU'`
  * `'Indoor office'`
  * `'Indoor shopping mall'`
* `PLOT`: set for plotting environment and result or not. You can set it as
  * `1`: Yes.
  * `0`: No.
* `TX_index`: choose the index of the anchor for simulation. You can set it as
  * `'all'`: Simulation with all anchors
  * If you want to use a specific anchor for simulation, you can enter the index of the anchors after you see the map.png in the environment‚Äôs folder.
* `RX_mode`: choose the simulation mode for simulation. You can set it as
  * `'XYGrid'`: Simulation with all agents.
  * `'RandomTraj'`: Simulation with agents on randomly generated trajectories.
  * `'LoadTraj'`: simulation with agents on designed trajectories.
* `traj_num`: The number of the trajectory
  * `1`: If you set `RX_mode = 'XYGrid'` or `RX_mode = 'LoadTraj'`, you must set `traj_num = 1`.
  * Otherwise, you can enter any number as the number of the trajectory.
* `traj_len`: The length (step number) of a trajectory
  * `1`: If you set `RX_mode = 'XYGrid'` or `RX_mode = 'LoadTraj'`, you must set `traj_len = 1`.
  * Otherwise,  you can enter any number as the length of the trajectory.

### Step 5: Set the parameters in ‚ÄúSetTransmission.m‚Äù.
* `noise_level`: The noise variance.
* `fft_num`: The FFT point.
* `sub_num`: The number of the subcarrier.
* `f_subcar`: The subcarrier spacing (Hz).

### Step 6: Set the parameters in ‚ÄúSetAntenna.m‚Äù.
* `ant_pos`: The antennas‚Äô position relative to the first antenna. Each row contains the x, y, and z coordinates of each antenna, and the unit is half-wavelength.
  * For example, if you want to estimate the AoA of the signals with the array shown in Figure 4, you can set `ant_pos = [[0 0 0];[1 0 0];[1 1 0];[0 1 0]];`
* `ele_table`: The estimation range of the elevation, which is ùúô in Figure 4.
* `azi_table`: The estimation range of the azimuth, which is Œ∏ in Figure 4.

### Step 7: Run the main code. 
You will see the estimation results of the parameters between an anchor and an agent, as shown in Figure 5. In particular, the elevation ranges from -90Àö to 90Àö, while -90Àö to -1Àö marked as 270Àö to 359Àö on the plot.
