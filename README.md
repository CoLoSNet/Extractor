# Extractor
MATLAB code for CSI extract simulation

## What is Extractor Simulation?
Extractor Simulation is a tool that 
- provides the database from Remcom 3D ray-tracing.
- generates the channel frequency response (CFR) for different bandwidths and antenna arrays.
- estimates the location-bearing parameters, such as received signal strength (RSS), time of arrival (TOA), or angle of arrival (AOA), of the propagation paths from the CFR.
